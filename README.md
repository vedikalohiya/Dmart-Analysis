# Dmart Sales Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes sales data from **Dmart**, focusing on products, brands, categories, subcategories, and monthly trends. Using Python libraries such as **pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**, we explore the dataset to identify top-selling products, high-performing brands, and seasonal patterns.
